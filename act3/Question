Is that first slash in \Animal\Adorable\Koala necessary?

A) Yes. If you choose to not have a use statement,
then you must always start with a \ so that PHP knows to build the namespace from the root of all namespaces.

B) No. The slash is always optional, and
really redundant: PHP knows that you are looking for a class from the root of the namespace.

C)It depends on whether or not this file lives in the same namespace.
